# Example .env file for dual-bucket architecture
# You need to create two separate DigitalOcean Spaces buckets and access keys

# DigitalOcean Spaces Configuration
DO_SPACES_ENDPOINT=nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
DO_SPACES_REGION=nyc3

# ZERO-KNOWLEDGE BUCKET (Highly Restricted Access)
# Create a separate access key with ONLY PutObject and DeleteObject permissions
# This key should NOT have GetObject permissions for maximum security

DO_SPACES_ZK_KEY=your_zero_knowledge_key_here

# SERVER-MANAGED BUCKET (Full Access for LLM Processing)
# This key needs GetObject, PutObject, and DeleteObject permissions
# Server can read these files for AI analysis and LLM features

# SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. Zero-knowledge bucket key should have minimal permissions (PUT/DELETE only)
# 2. Server-managed bucket key can have full permissions for AI processing
# 3. Use different access keys to limit blast radius if compromised
# 4. Consider using separate DigitalOcean accounts for maximum isolation
