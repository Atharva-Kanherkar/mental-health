```typescript
const companionTemplates = {
  positive: [
    "I love seeing this positive energy from you! Your growth really shows.",
    "This joy is contagious! Keep nurturing these beautiful moments.",
    // ... more templates
  ],
  struggling: [
    "I can feel the weight you're carrying. You're stronger than you know.",
    "Tough days don't last, but resilient people like you do.",
    // ... more templates
  ]
};
```

### Phase 2: Smart Selection Algorithm
