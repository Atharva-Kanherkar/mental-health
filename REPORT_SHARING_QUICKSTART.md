## Testing the System

### 1. Create a Share Link (Mobile App or API)

#### Via API (for testing):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/share/create \
  -H "Cookie: better-auth.session_token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reportType": "comprehensive",
    "expiryDays": 30,
    "days": 30
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "shareUrl": "https://api.my-echoes.app/share/abc123...",
    "password": "gentle-moon-7432",
    "expiresAt": "2025-02-13T...",
    "reportType": "comprehensive",
    "message": "Share link created successfully..."
  }
}
```

### 2. View Report (As Therapist)

#### Browser:
1. Open the `shareUrl` from step 1
2. Enter the password when prompted
3. View the beautiful HTML report
4. Optional: Add `/pdf` to URL to download PDF

#### CLI (for testing):
```bash
# View HTML report
curl "http://localhost:8080/share/TOKEN?password=PASSWORD"

# Download PDF
curl "http://localhost:8080/share/TOKEN/pdf?password=PASSWORD" -o report.pdf
```

### 3. Manage Links

```bash
# Get all your links
curl http://localhost:8080/api/share/my-links \
  -H "Cookie: better-auth.session_token=YOUR_TOKEN"

# Get link stats
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/share/TOKEN/stats" \
  -H "Cookie: better-auth.session_token=YOUR_TOKEN"

# Revoke a link
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/api/share/TOKEN" \
  -H "Cookie: better-auth.session_token=YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. User Shares Report with Therapist

**User Actions:**
1. Tap "Share" button in Insights screen
2. Wait 2-3 seconds for report generation
3. Share link and password via:

  onClose={() => setShowModal(false)}
  reportType="weekly"  // 7 days
  days={7}
/>
```

### 3. User Revokes Access

```typescript
// After sharing, user changes mind
const links = await api.share.getMyLinks();
const tokenToRevoke = links[0].shareToken;
await api.share.revokeLink(tokenToRevoke);
// Link immediately becomes inactive
```

## Troubleshooting

### Report Generation Fails
- **Check:** User has at least some check-in data
- **Check:** Database connection is active
- **Check:** All required services are running

### Password Doesn't Work
- **Check:** Password is entered exactly as shown (case-sensitive)
- **Check:** Link hasn't expired (30 days default)
- **Check:** Link wasn't revoked by user
- **Check:** Max views (10) not exceeded

### PDF Download Fails
- **Check:** Puppeteer is installed (`npm list puppeteer`)
- **Check:** Server has enough memory
- **Check:** Port 8080 is accessible

### Share Button Not Showing
- **Check:** ShareModal component is imported
- **Check:** showShareModal state is defined
- **Check:** Modal is rendered in JSX

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test Report Generation**
   ```bash
   # Create a test share link
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/share/create \
     -H "Cookie: better-auth.session_token=TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"reportType": "comprehensive"}'
   ```

2. **Test Password Protection**
   - Try accessing link without password
   - Try with wrong password
   - Try with correct password

3. **Test PDF Export**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8080/share/TOKEN/pdf?password=PASSWORD" -o test-report.pdf
   open test-report.pdf  # macOS
   xdg-open test-report.pdf  # Linux
   ```

4. **Test Mobile App**
   - Launch app
   - Go to Insights
   - Tap "Share" button
   - Verify QR code displays
   - Test copy/paste functionality
   - Test system share

5. **Test Access Control**
   - Access link 10 times
   - Verify 11th access is denied
   - Test expired link (set expiryDays to 0.001 for testing)
