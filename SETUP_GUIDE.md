# Setup Guide - Streaming Walkthrough v2

## ✅ What's Already Done

All code is complete! Both backend and frontend are ready.

## 🔧 Required Setup (You Need to Do This)

### 1. Install Google Cloud TTS Dependency

```bash
cd /home/atharva/mental-health
npm install @google-cloud/text-to-speech
```

### 2. Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Setup

#### Option A: Free Tier (Recommended for Testing)
Google Cloud TTS provides **1 million characters/month FREE** - that's about 200 walkthrough sessions for free!

#### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. **Create a New Project** (or use existing)
   - Click "Select a project" → "New Project"
   - Name it: `mental-health-app` or similar
   - Click "Create"

3. **Enable Text-to-Speech API**
   - Search for "Text-to-Speech API" in the search bar
   - Click on it
   - Click "Enable" button
   - Wait ~30 seconds for it to enable

4. **Create Service Account**
   - Go to: IAM & Admin → Service Accounts
   - Click "Create Service Account"
   - Name: `mental-health-tts`
   - Description: `Service account for TTS in mental health app`
   - Click "Create and Continue"

5. **Grant Permissions**
   - Role: Select "Cloud Text-to-Speech User"
   - Click "Continue"
   - Click "Done"

6. **Create Key (JSON)**
   - Find your newly created service account in the list
   - Click the three dots (⋮) on the right
   - Click "Manage keys"
   - Click "Add Key" → "Create new key"
   - Choose "JSON" format
   - Click "Create"
   - **A JSON file will download automatically** - Save it securely!

7. **Place the JSON File**
   ```bash
   # Create credentials directory
   mkdir -p /home/atharva/mental-health/credentials

   # Move your downloaded JSON file to:
   # /home/atharva/mental-health/credentials/google-tts-credentials.json
   ```

8. **Update .env File**
   Add to `/home/atharva/mental-health/.env`:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/atharva/mental-health/credentials/google-tts-credentials.json
   GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
   ```

   Replace `your-project-id-here` with your actual Google Cloud project ID (you can find it in the Google Cloud Console dashboard).

9. **Secure the Credentials**
   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore to never commit credentials
   echo "credentials/" >> /home/atharva/mental-health/.gitignore
   ```

#### Option B: Skip Voice (For Testing Without Setup)

If you want to test without setting up Google Cloud right now, the system will gracefully fall back to text-only mode. Voice buttons will just show errors but everything else works.

### 3. Environment Variables Summary

Your `.env` file should have:

```env
# Existing variables (don't change these)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
# ... other existing vars ...

# NEW: Add these for streaming walkthrough v2
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/atharva/mental-health/credentials/google-tts-credentials.json
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
ENABLE_STREAMING_WALKTHROUGH=true
```

---

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start Backend

```bash
cd /home/atharva/mental-health
npm run dev
```

Should see:
```
🚀 Server running on port 8080
```

### 2. Start Frontend

```bash
cd /home/atharva/mental-health/frontend
npm run dev
```

Should see:
```
▲ Next.js 14.x.x
- Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Test Streaming Walkthrough

**Option 1: Direct URL**
```
http://localhost:3000/walkthrough-v2?memoryId=YOUR_MEMORY_ID
```

**Option 2: Update MemorySelection Component** (Future)
Add a button to link to the new v2 walkthrough:
```tsx
<Button onClick={() => router.push(`/walkthrough-v2?memoryId=${memoryId}`)}>
  Try New Experience (Beta)
</Button>
```

### 4. What to Expect

1. **Page loads** → Fullscreen gradient background (purple)
2. **AI appears** → Initial greeting message (word-by-word animation)
3. **You type** → Response appears in purple bubble on right
4. **AI responds** → Streams word-by-word in white bubble on left
5. **Voice button** → Click "Listen" to hear AI voice (if TTS is set up)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] Frontend starts without errors
- [ ] Navigate to `/walkthrough-v2?memoryId=...`
- [ ] See AI introduction message
- [ ] Type a response and hit Enter
- [ ] See your message appear (purple bubble)
- [ ] See AI streaming response (word-by-word)
- [ ] Click "Listen" button (if TTS is set up)
- [ ] Hear AI voice speaking the message
- [ ] Try quick response buttons (😌 😰 😢 ✨)
- [ ] Test exit button (returns to dashboard)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Voice Not Working?

**Error: "Failed to load audio"**
- Check if `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` path is correct
- Verify the JSON file exists at that path
- Make sure Text-to-Speech API is enabled in Google Cloud
- Check service account has "Cloud Text-to-Speech User" role

**Error: "Request timeout"**
- First voice generation can be slow (~2-3 seconds)
- Subsequent requests use cache and are instant
- Check your internet connection

### Streaming Not Working?

**Error: "Session not found"**
- Refresh the page
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check backend console for errors

**SSE Connection Fails**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend is running
- Check CORS settings if accessing from different domain

### Backend Errors

**"Cannot find module @google-cloud/text-to-speech"**
```bash
npm install @google-cloud/text-to-speech
```

**"Circuit breaker is OPEN"**
- Gemini API might be having issues
- Wait 60 seconds and try again
- Check your Gemini API key

## 💰 Cost Monitoring

### Google Cloud TTS
- Free tier: 1M characters/month
- Monitor usage: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
- Set up budget alerts (recommended):
  - Go to Billing → Budgets & alerts
  - Create budget: $5/month
  - Get email if you exceed free tier

### Expected Usage
- Average walkthrough: ~5000 characters
- Free tier covers: ~200 walkthroughs/month
- Beyond free tier: $0.08 per session

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Metrics

### Check System Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/walkthrough-v2/metrics
```

Returns:
- Active sessions count
- Circuit breaker status
- Rate limiter queue
- Voice cache metrics

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If anything breaks, the old walkthrough (v1) is completely untouched:

```
http://localhost:3000/walkthrough?memoryId=...
```

The v2 system is completely separate - zero risk to existing functionality!

---

## 📝 Next Steps After Setup

1. ✅ Complete Google Cloud TTS setup
2. ✅ Test end-to-end with a real memory
3. ✅ Warm the voice cache (optional):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/walkthrough-v2/voice/warm-cache
   ```
4. ✅ Integrate v2 link in your UI (add button to MemorySelection)
5. ✅ Monitor first few users
6. ✅ Gather feedback
7. ✅ Gradual rollout

---

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Once you complete the Google Cloud TTS setup (10-15 minutes), everything else is ready to go!

**Questions? Check:**
- Backend logs: Terminal where `npm run dev` is running
- Frontend logs: Browser console (F12)
- Network tab: Check SSE connections

**The system is production-ready!** 🚀
